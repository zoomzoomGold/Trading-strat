Backtest from 2010-2023 shows that the 50/200-day SMA Crossover strategy on SPY provided no statistical benefit over a simple Buy-and-Hold approach.

It delivered lower risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe Ratio 0.66 vs 0.79) and no downside protection (same max dragdown beteen strategy and benchmark).

The strategy's 'lag' in signaling trades caused it to miss gains while still capturing all of the market's major losses.
